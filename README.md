# Test Git Setup (December 15, 2019)
This is the first project I am making on a raspberry pi.
 - I am experimenting with connecting a Github repository with this project folder.
 - I am currently following a tutorial on the raspberry pi website:
   projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-wit-git/6
